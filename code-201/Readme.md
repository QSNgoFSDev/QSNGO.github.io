# **Growth Mindset**
## Definition

A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

1. **_Challenges_**
Here’s an example of when I wasn’t in the right mindset: learning Java. I studied a bit of Java at university, and have worked with it in almost every role I’ve had (including my current gig as a developer on Jira Software), and yet I still find it hard to get my head around.

When I’m faced with a challenging coding problem, I have a tendency to work over one particular aspect of it again and again until I conclude that it’s impossible or that I’m incapable of solving it. I throw my hands up in surrender and stop. In other words, I’m in a fixed mindset and avoiding the problem by giving up.

So, lately, I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset. When I’m ready, I walk through the problem once again, bit by bit, looking for new ways to think about it until I start to see another way forward. And for me, it always helps to talk through these steps – out loud, not just in my head. I jot down clues as they come about. Soon enough (and rather miraculously), I begin to find root causes of the problem.

2. **_Effort_**
I have similar troubles with cycling. When my alarm goes off at 5 A.M., the thought of going out on the bike is dreadful. The temptation to stay in bed is strong, strong, strong – curse you, instant gratification monkey – but I also know the feeling won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later, as always. The trite-but-true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset!

And on the mornings when I get up and ride? I feel better. It’s hard work, sure, and the good feeling isn’t instantaneous (though sometimes it is). But when the ride is over and my body feels better, my spirit is stronger. I’m proud of myself, and that goes a long, long way.

So when I find myself reaching for the snooze button, I consider all this. I make a conscious effort to stop and think about the growth mindset. I ask myself, is going back to sleep really what I want to do? Am I giving up too easily? Would I rather shower off pangs of regret, or the sweat of accomplishment? C’mon, the answers are obvious.

3.  **_Success of others_**
My team inclydes some of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with. But I didn’t always think this way.

For a long time, I was fiercely jealous of people I thought were more successful or more intelligent. But, with the help of our culture of openness and honesty, I was able to understand how the work I do relates to the work of my peers, and how it all comes together to create something awesome.

So, where I once perceived those I deemed smarter as adversaries, I now see them as dedicated colleagues with a passion for learning. Where I once saw (and was jealous of) more successful managers, I now see peers with skills that complement mine, and together we’re doing some of the best work of our lives. You see, this is the growth mindset at its finest. Where a fixed mindset leads you to see the success of others as a threat, the growth mindset encourages you to see the success of coworkers as an inspiration. See, I told you it was cool.

Some open and frank conversations with my fellow Atlassians during peer reviews, one-on-ones, and even in casual hallway interactions helped me in this shift of mindset. Because that’s another amazing thing about the way our company works: we have access to literally everyone in the company.

It might not be possible to retrofit a company to have a similar level of openness and commitment to authenticity, but it’s not too hard to adopt the growth mindset concepts to influence peer interactions. We can choose to be more transparent or more helpful than might be required or than we’re used to. In other words, we can choose to go the extra mile, we can choose to be quick to praise and slow to criticize. We can choose to seek first to understand.
