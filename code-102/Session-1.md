Canvas Setup
When you complete your course enrollment, you will get an email inviting you to join Canvas for this course. Follow the instructions in the email to get connected.

Once you’ve gotten the hang of it, there are a few key settings that are important for you to adjust right away.

In the nav column at the left, click Account. Open the Settings page from there. Then, click on the Edit Settings button on the right. Make sure your timezone is set correctly.
Add your complete name, and other full contact information. Please include backup email (if you have one), and a phone number (useful in case of emergency).
